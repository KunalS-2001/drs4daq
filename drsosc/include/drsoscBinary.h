   Name:           read_binary.cpp
   Created by:     Stefan Ritt <stefan.ritt@psi.ch>
   Date:           July 30th, 2014

   Purpose:        Example file to read binary data saved by DRSOsc.
 
   Compile and run it with:
 
      gcc -o read_binary read_binary.cpp
 
      ./read_binary <filename>

   This program assumes that a pulse from a signal generator is split
   and fed into channels #1 and #2. It then calculates the time difference
   between these two pulses to show the performance of the DRS board
   for time measurements.
